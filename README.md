# AAI521-group4
Group 4 Final Team Project for AAI521 Applied Computer Vision for AI. 

This project is a part of the AAI-521 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD). 

The main purpose of this project is to assess the application of computer vision introduced in this course. Team will brainstorm a problem, find a dataset, clean and pre-process it, and perform a computer vision project on the data using Python.
